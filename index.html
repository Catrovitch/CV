  <h1>Curriculum vitae of Catrovitch</h1>
  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>Hi, my name is Catrovitch and I am a person who has many interests. I study computer science and have many other projects at the side as well. For example I am currently working on a music album, a card game, a computer game, a musical, a clothing brand, a cook book, a film, and many more.</p>
  <p>The key is ofcourse to prioritise, otherwise nothing will ever be completed. Currently my main focus is my formal education, while I try to progress on my music album and computer game as best I can. The rest I will do in due time.</p>
